Description: typesetting system
 Groff (GNU troff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text mixed
 with formatting commands and produces formatted output. Output may be
 PostScript or PDF, html, or ASCII/UTF8 for display at the terminal.
 Formatting commands may be either low-level typesetting requests
 (“primitives”) or macros from a supplied set. Users may also write
 their own macros. All three may be combined. Present on most Unix
 systems owing to its long association with Unix manuals (manpages),
 groff is capable of producing typographically sophisticated documents
 while consuming only minimal system resources.
